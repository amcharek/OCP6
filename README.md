# Stackoverflow Questions and Tags


Stack Overflow is a famous question and answer site related to IT development. To ask a question on this site, you must enter several tags so that you can easily find the question afterwards. For experienced users, this is not a problem, but for new users, it would be wise to suggest some tags related to the question asked.

In the scope of my DataScience training with Openclassrooms, I will have to help the community in return. To do this, I will develop a tag suggestion system for the site. This will take the form of a machine learning algorithm which automatically assigns several relevant tags to a question.
